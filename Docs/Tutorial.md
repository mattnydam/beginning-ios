# Tutorial 


## Prerequisites 

Within the workspace there are different stages. We will start at Stage Zero and work primarily in this porjct. if at any point you get stuck, you can always switch to a different project stage. Ie., If you are following along with a class and instructor and they have progressed to stage 3 and you are still a little stuck on 1, then you can just open up the stage 3 project and all the relevant files will be up to date :) 

## Stage Zero Notes

- Talk about app delegate
- Normal app structure in general, things to ignore

_Stage Zero Outcome:_ Walk through general project structure and talk about different view types. Empty table view implemented.
