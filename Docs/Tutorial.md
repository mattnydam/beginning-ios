# Tutorial 


Within the workspace there are different stages. We will start at Stage Zero and work primarily in this porjct. if at any point you get stuck, you can always switch to a different project stage. Ie., If you are following along with a class and instructor and they have progressed to stage 3 and you are still a little stuck on 1, then you can just open up the stage 3 project and all the relevant files will be up to date :) 


## Prerequisites 


## Stage Zero Notes

- Talk about app delegate
- Normal app structure in general, things to ignore

Walk through general project structure and talk about different view types. Empty table view implemented.

**Stage Zero Outcome:** We will have a tableview populated with plain string data. When we tap a table view cell we will push to a new screen and pass the data across. 

## Stage One Notes

**Stage One Outcome:** We will have a new SavingsGoal model object. Our table view and detail view will now display these instead of a normal string. 

## Stage Two Notes

**Stage Two Outcome:** We will create a view that will allow us to make new Model objects and save them to NSUserDefaults. We will read all of our data from there from now on. 

## Stage Three Notes

**Stage Three Outcome:** We want to be able to update our savings goals and delete our savings goals. On the detail screen we should be able to update the data or delete the goal. 

## Stage Four Notes

**Stage Four Outcome:** Let's pretty things up a bit. We will create custom table view cells and spruce up the look of our creation and detail views.
